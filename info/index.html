                        Studied Computer Science at UTD for 3 years. I learned a vast variety of subjects ranging from object-oriented programming to database management systems to digital logic. Worked as part of a team for a Computer Science Senior Project where we created an Android Application. The specificiations of the app were provided to us by an industry contact, our role was to implement this within a single semester. Our finished product was awarded 1<sup>st</sup> place in the Spring 2015 UTDesign Senior Expo.

                            Currently working as a Software Engineer for JP Morgan Chase, specifically within the Identity and Access Management organization of the company. I am part of a team which deals with various types of operations for secrets management. The projects that I have worked on in this space are primarily RESTful APIs written in Java using the Springboot framework with PL/SQL and MySql as the data stores. Additionally there are agents which need to be installed on hosts, this is automated via Ansible, and supports both Linux and Windows hosts. All of the projects are fully CI/CD, managed individually by the development team, utilizing Jenkins as the build server.
